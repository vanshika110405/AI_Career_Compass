# AI Career Compass

An intelligent web application that predicts the most suitable career path based on your skills using machine learning and NLP.

---

## Overview

**AI Career Compass** is designed to assist users‚Äîespecially students and professionals‚Äîin identifying potential career paths aligned with their skill sets. It uses a trained machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) on a curated dataset to make intelligent recommendations, showing job demand, salary potential, and growth outlook.

---

## Features

- Skill-based career prediction
- Career insights (average salary, demand, and growth score)
- Machine Learning model trained with TF-IDF & Random Forest
- Visual representation of popular careers
- Simple and intuitive Flask web interface

## Algorithm & Deployment

We used the **Random Forest Classifier**, a robust ensemble learning algorithm known for its accuracy and ability to handle feature importance across large datasets. It works well with our TF-IDF transformed feature matrix of user skills.

Input is taken as raw text (skills) and processed using **NLP techniques**. The cleaned data is vectorized using **TF-IDF**, trained on labeled career data, and the model is saved using **Joblib**. The model then predicts a matching career path and displays additional insights.
